MLBOX is no longer being maintained. Need to remove.
Auto-sklearn has a new verion out. Need to update notebooks.
Tpot also has updates that need to be incorporated.
Both use dask for parallelization now.

There are many proprietary and open source AutoML tools available. This project dives into a few of them with the goal of getting you started with hands-on AutoML in Domino. 

## Project Contents

* [auto-sklearn.ipynb](./view/auto-sklearn.ipynb), a how-to notebook
* [tpot.ipynb](./view/tpot.ipynb), a how-to notebook
* [mlbox.ipynb](./view/MLBox.ipynb), a how-to notebook
* AutoML Launcher, associated [configuration file](./view/launcher_config.txt), and [launcher set up doc](./view/launcher_setup.md)
* [automl.py](./view/automl.py), the code behind the Launcher
* sample data files

## Suggested Actions

* Browse the notebooks. They are writen as tutorials on how to use the various automl packages.
* Copy or Fork this project to run the notebooks on your own. 
* Follow the instructions in the [launcher set up doc](./view/launcher_setup.md) to create your own AutoML Launcher.
